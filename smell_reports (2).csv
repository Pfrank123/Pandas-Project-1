So we must at least start documenting it every time he burns trash which definitely includes old building/construction materials which may be plastic or rubber and or probably asbestos.  It smells extremely poisonous and toxic because it is. And this affects the entire neighborhood. His air pollution immediately makes any of us who smell it feel sick. It is definitely NOT from wood smoke. It's toxic trash he's burning illegally, and unfortunately frequently. We do not want to call the cops yet cause that would upset him more. But eventually may have to. For now we just need to document it with ACHD.  We may need to ask the health department to contact him, but first we will try politely asking him to stop. Thank you."
